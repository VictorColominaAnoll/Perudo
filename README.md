## How to play? ðŸŽ®

1. Every player starts with 5 dices. The dices contain the following values: 

- Toucan (acts like a "joker", which means that can be any other number, or can be a toucan).
- Number 2
- Number 3
- Number 4
- Number 5
- Number 6

2. Every round, players will roll the dices and will get random values. Players only know their own values.

3. The first player needs to bet how many dices are **on the table** (player's dices + the other players' dices). The player needs to bet based on:
- Value of the dices (Toucan, 2, 3...)
- Number of dices with that value

4. Next player will decide if the bet is true or false. 
- If it's false, the players will show their dices. If the challenger player was true, the challenged player will lose a dice. If it was false, then the challenger will lose a dice.
- If the player thinks that it is true, then the player needs to raise the bet. The player can:
  - Raise the value. For example: if the current value is 2, the player can raise the value to 4.
  - Raise the number of dices with that value. For example: if the current number is 3, the player can say it is 6.
  - Raise both at the same time. For example: if the current values are 3 dices with value 2, the player can raise to 4 dices with value 6.
  - ðŸ’« **Special move** - Split the current number by two and convert it to toucans. For example: If the current number is 3/4 with value 6, the player can switch to 2 toucans. Then, the next player needs to raise using toucans value, or, can change to any other value, but the number needs to be (current number * 2 + 1). For example: if the current number is 2 toucans, then the player can switch to 5 dices with value 3.

5. If you run out of dices, you can't continue playing.
